# LaTeX-Exam
This repository contains a custom exam template, utilizing the exam document class.

To take advantage of all features, utilize
* \elasticvfill rather than \vfill
* \elasticnewpage rather than \newpage
This allowa the if statements to conditionally remove all spacing, and some instruction text, in the document, perfect for a compact draft.

Note, this LaTeX file requires SageTeX to run.
